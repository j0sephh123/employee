# Goal
1. Have fun without strict requirements
2. Do not leave the code editor and terminal at least initially
3. Business logic should be pretty simple - managing employees. I don't want to have to think about that so I can only focus on code.  

## Prevent commits when:
1. < 100% test coverage
2. eslint fails
3. `any`

# Ideas 
They are not mandatory, just want to have them somewhere  
- generate documentation based on typescript
