# Goal

1. Have fun without strict requirements
2. Do not leave the code editor and terminal at least initially
3. Business logic should be pretty simple - managing employees. I don't want to have to think about that so I can only focus on code.

# Features

## Employee

- ✅ create
  - ✅ validate name for length `[2,20]`
- 🛠️ remove
- 🛠️ modify name

## Company
- ✅ create
  - 🛠️ validate name for length `[2,20]`
- ✅ add employee
  - 🛠️ prevent duplicate employees
- 🛠️ remove
- 🛠️ modify name

# Tech

Nothing interesting here (for now)

- **Jest** - simply because I use it at work and want to become better at it

## Prevent commits when:

- ✅ < 100% test coverage
- 🛠️ eslint fails
- 🛠️ `any`

# Ideas

They are not mandatory, just want to have them somewhere

- generate documentation based on typescript
